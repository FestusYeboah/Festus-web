    <img src="image 4.jpg" alt="Becoming a web developer"/>
<p>It has been tough although but I am manging.I have been learning new skills from different websites like the free code camp.
My lecturer has been on me since l started this journey. Free code camp hasn't been easy. "sorry, you are almost there". These are the responses you get from free code camp when you are not getting it right. 
this means you have to go back and check your code. Its been an interesting journey and very educative. I have been learning a lot from the freecodecamp, at first i knew nothing about html, css, etc. but since 
my lecturer introduce the freecodecamp app to me andhow it works, Oh my God, now i call myself a <b>website Developer</b>, very funny. i have also gain new skills and knowledge, now i am looking forward to work for big comapanies 
such as Promasidor etc.</p>
